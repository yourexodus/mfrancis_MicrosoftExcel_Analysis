# ðŸŽ§ Music Industry Revenue Project: Composition Analysis

This repository contains the analysis and visualization of music industry revenue over a 40-year period, focusing on the shift in composition between **Physical** and **Digital** formats.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

The primary objective was to visualize the **revenue composition over time** for Physical and Digital music products to communicate the industry's historical transition to a general audience. The visualization choice was a **Stacked Area Chart**, as it is ideal for showing composition over a time series.

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualization Development Steps

The following steps detail the creation and formatting of the final **Stacked Area Chart** using data visualization best practices.

### 1. Chart Selection and Data Order

1.  **Selection:** Inserted a standard Stacked Area Chart.
2.  **Fixing Stacking Order:** The initial chart obscured the Digital baseline because it was stacked second. This was corrected by switching the series order so that **Digital** appeared *first* in the data list, allowing its baseline to be visible.
    * **Result after Fixing Stack Order:**
        * ![Chart with Corrected Digital Baseline](images/viewDigitalbaseline.jpg)

### 2. Formatting for Clarity (Reducing Noise)

| Action | Technique | Image |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Add Title** | Clearly labeled the chart to inform the user. | ![Chart After Adding Title](images/AfterAddedTitile.jpg) |
| **Remove Gridlines** | Unchecked the **Gridlines** option using the Chart Elements menu. | ![Chart Elements Menu](images/clickPlusSign.jpg) |
| **Add Y-Axis Title** | Added **Revenue** as the vertical axis title. | ![Chart with Revenue Title](images/AddRevenueTitle.jpg) |

### 3. Cleaning Up the Y-Axis (Revenue)

A custom number format was applied to correctly display revenue in billions and reduce redundant zeros.

1.  **Initial Adjustment (Millions):** Added `"M"` to the end of the format string.
    * **Result after adding 'M':**
        * ![Y-Axis with 'M' for Millions](images/AfterMillion.jpg)
2.  **Final Adjustment (Billions):** Used the custom format `\$#,##0, "B"` to scale the data to billions and drop redundant zeros.
    * **Result after converting to Billions:**
        * ![Y-Axis formatted to Billions](images/BillionWithLegend.jpg)

### 4. Final Polish and Legend Removal

1.  **Move/Adjust Legend:** The legend was moved to the bottom and expanded.
    * **Legend Moved and Adjusted:**

2.  **Set Text Size:** Standardized all axis labels to **Text Size 11** and deleted the years off the source data to clean up the X-axis labels.
    * **Result after deleting source years:**
        * ![X-Axis Years Deleted](images/All10yearsdeleted.jpg)
3.  **Direct Labeling:** Text boxes for **PHYSICAL** and **DIGITAL** were added directly to the chart areas, and the redundant legend was deleted.
