# ðŸŽ§ Music Industry Revenue Project: Composition Analysis

This repository contains the analysis and visualization of music industry revenue over a 40-year period, focusing on the shift in composition between **Physical** and **Digital** formats.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

The primary objective was to visualize the **revenue composition over time** for Physical and Digital music products to communicate the industry's historical transition to a general audience.

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualization Development Steps

The following steps detail the creation and formatting of the final **Stacked Area Chart** using data visualization best practices.

### 1. Chart Selection and Data Order

1.  **Selection:** Inserted a standard Stacked Area Chart after selecting the entire data range.
2.  **Fixing Stacking Order:** The initial chart obscured the Digital baseline. This was corrected by switching the series order so that **Digital** appeared *first* in the data list, allowing its baseline to be visible.

### 2. Formatting for Clarity (Reducing Noise)

| Action | Technique | Before | After |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Add Title** | Clearly labeled the chart to inform the user. | `[Image: chart_before_title.png]` | `[Image: chart_after_title.png]` |
| **Remove Border** | Set **Shape Outline** to **No Outline**. | `[Image: chart_before_border.png]` | `[Image: chart_after_border.png]` |
| **Remove Gridlines** | Unchecked the **Gridlines** option (or manually deleted them). | `[Image: chart_before_grid.png]` | `[Image: chart_after_grid.png]` |

### 3. Cleaning Up the Y-Axis (Revenue)

A custom number format was applied to correctly display revenue in billions and reduce redundant zeros, making the axis labels scannable.

1.  **Access Formatting:** Right-click Y-Axis $\rightarrow$ **Format Axis** $\rightarrow$ **Number** $\rightarrow$ **Custom**.
2.  **Initial Adjustment (Millions):** Added `"M"` to the end of the format string (e.g., `\$#,##0"M"`).
3.  **Final Adjustment (Billions):** Changed the format to tell Excel to drop the last three digits and display the scale in Billions.
    * **Final Custom Format:** `\$#,##0, "B"` (The comma before "B" scales the number by $1,000$).
4.  **Axis Title:** Added the title **Revenue** to the primary vertical axis.

### 4. Final Polish and Legend Removal

1.  **Set Text Size:** Standardized all axis labels to **Text Size 11**.
2.  **Direct Labeling:** Instead of using the legend, text boxes were added directly to the chart areas for **PHYSICAL** and **DIGITAL** (improving data ink ratio).
    * The redundant chart legend was then **deleted**.
