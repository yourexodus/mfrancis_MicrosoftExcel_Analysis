# ðŸ“Š Data Visualization Portfolio: Insights and Best Practices

This repository showcases four projects where I apply best-in-class data visualization and storytelling principles, moving data from raw numbers to actionable insights.

The entire portfolio is built on the core philosophy: **"Perfection is achieved when there is nothing left to take away."** (Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry)

## ðŸŒŸ My DataViz Philosophy (Lessons Learned)

My approach to every visualization is guided by the essential rules and pro tips summarized below to ensure clarity and impact.

### **The Essentials: Choosing the Right Chart**

| Chart Type | Communication Goal | Data Type | Key Best Practice |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Line Chart** | Trend & Comparison | Time-series | Dates **must be continuous** (no gaps). |
| **Area Chart** | Comparison & Composition | Time-series | Shows how the **total and its parts change** over time. |
| **Bar Chart** | Comparison | Categorical | **Always start the baseline at 0**. |
| **Pie Chart** | Composition | Categorical | **Keep slices under 5** and focus on one part. |
| **100% Stacked Bar** | Composition & Comparison | Categorical | Use for **proportion over time**; difficult for middle section comparison. |
| **Treemap** | Composition | Hierarchical | Used for data with **natural groups and sub-groups**. |
| **Scatter Plot** | Relationship | Any | **Correlation does not imply causation**. |
| **Table** | Detail & Actual Values | Categorical | Use a **color scale** to highlight patterns or outliers. |
| **Map** | Comparison | Geospatial | Use a **diverging color scale** to compare against a baseline (e.g., average). |

### **Pro-Tips: Eliminating Noise and Enhancing Story**

| Area | Pro Tip | Storytelling Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Formatting** | **Avoid Cluttered Charts**. Remove chart border and gridlines. | **Leverage the chart title** to clearly call out the most important insight. |
| **Clarity** | Format axis labels clearly and strategically. | **Emphasize key points** using **bold text** and deliberate use of color. |
| **Focus** | Use color and labels strategically instead of relying on a legend. | Use **markers and data labels** to draw attention to meaningful data points. |
| **Context** | Make sure the story is clear and every element improves understanding. | Use shapes & text boxes to add custom annotations or change the layout. |

## ðŸš€ Project Portfolio

These projects demonstrate the application of these best practices to solve real-world analytical problems.

### **1. ðŸŽ§ Music Industry Revenue Project: Composition Analysis**

* **Focus:** Historical composition of **US Music Revenue** (1973â€“2019), demonstrating the critical transition from Physical to Digital formats.
* **Key Visuals:** A highly formatted **Stacked Area Chart** optimized for showing part-to-whole relationships over time.
* **Storytelling Highlight:** Achieved high data clarity by implementing best practices, including custom axis formatting (converting Millions to Billions), removing chart noise (gridlines, borders), and fixing the data stacking order to show a clear Digital baseline.
* **Repository Link:** [https://github.com/yourexodus/mfrancis\_MicrosoftExcel\_Analysis/blob/main/Music\_Industry/readme.md](https://github.com/yourexodus/mfrancis_MicrosoftExcel_Analysis/blob/main/Music_Industry/readme.md)

### **2. Deep Dive Analysis: [Project Title 2 Here]**

* **Focus:** Granular breakdown and comparison for Analyst-level users.
* **Key Visuals:** Extensive use of **Tables with Conditional Formatting** and **Bar Charts** (baseline at 0) for categorical comparison.
* **Storytelling Highlight:** Used **Map visuals with diverging color scales** to pinpoint geographic regions where performance was significantly above/below the national average.

### **3. Customer Segmentation: [Project Title 3 Here]**

* **Focus:** Identifying relationships and composition within the customer base.
* **Key Visuals:** **Scatter Plots** to explore the correlation between customer tenure and lifetime value; **Pie Charts** (max 4 slices) for segment composition.
* **Storytelling Highlight:** Explicitly noted that observed correlations did not imply causation, adhering strictly to best practices for relational charts.
* **Repository Link:** [Link to Project 3 Folder or Live Demo]

### **4. Financial Hierarchy Report: [Project Title 4 Here]**

* **Focus:** Visualizing budget allocation and asset breakdown across departments.
* **Key Visuals:** **Treemaps** for visualizing the hierarchical composition of assets; **Area Charts** for showing the change in expense composition over the last three years.
* **Storytelling Highlight:** Used the Treemap's nested structure to clearly show that the Technology department accounted for the largest percentage of the total budget, instantly revealing the most significant group and sub-groups.
